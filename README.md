Emote SCSS files
================
Emotes works with SCSS files, on development you should change main.scss file and then generate main.css.
You must compile your sass stylesheets into CSS when they change.
This can be done in one of the following ways, go to sass folder under emote project:
  1. To compile on demand:
     compass compile
  2. To monitor your project for changes and automatically recompile:
     compass watch

If you don't have compass command line tool installed follow these steps:
